# Collection snapshots

Each `<name>.json` file here is one Obsidian Bases collection, written by
`node bin/app site collections` in the Workbench shell. Do not edit them by hand.

`src/content.config.ts` registers every `*.json` file in this folder as the Astro content
collection `<name>`. A snapshot holds:

- `schemaVersion`: `1`.
- `generatedBy`: the command that wrote it.
- `collection`: the Bases view as a file collection: the `.base` path, its SHA-256 and view, the
  view type, and `fields` (property, display name and inferred type, in column order).
- `records`: the matching notes in view order, each with its `path`, the view-column `values`,
  its `group` when the view groups, and its frontmatter `properties`.
